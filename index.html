        <p>
          I was born in Irving, Texas, on May 9th, 2005, and I’ve lived there
          for pretty much my entire life. It’s where I grew up and where many of
          my personal interests and hobbies first started to take shape. I’ve
          always been someone who enjoys doing things that spark my imagination
          or teach me something new. One of my biggest hobbies is playing video
          games. I love games that make me think and let me be part of a story.
          I especially enjoy turn-based games and CRPGs, or computer
          role-playing games. These types of games often have deep lore,
          branching narratives, and strategic combat systems that challenge me
          in unique ways. What I really enjoy about CRPGs is how they allow me
          to make choices that affect the world and characters around me. It
          makes the game feel personal, like I’m shaping a story that’s truly
          mine. The freedom and creativity involved in these kinds of games are
          what keep me coming back to them. Outside of gaming, one of my other
          big interests is mythology. I’ve always been fascinated by myths from
          different cultures—especially Greek and Japanese mythology. I find
          their stories not only entertaining, but also full of interesting
          stories, creatures, symbolism, and insight into the cultures they come
          from. That being said, my favorite mythological creature actually
          comes from Persian mythology: the Manticore. There’s something about
          it that I find incredibly cool—the combination of a lion’s body, a
          human face, and a scorpion tail, (though more recently it is sometimes
          depicted with a spiked tail and dragon wings), is just so wild and
          imaginative. It might not be as well-known as creatures like dragons
          or centaurs, but that makes it even more interesting to me. Another
          major interest of mine is history. I’ve always been curious about how
          the world got to where it is today, and history gives us those
          answers. I don’t have a single favorite time period or region—whether
          it’s Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, I’m interested in it all. I
          like learning how different societies functioned, how people lived day
          to day, what they believed in, and what kind of technology or
          knowledge they had access to. I find it fascinating to look at how
          different civilizations organized their governments, structured their
          classes, fought their wars, and created their art. To me, history
          isn’t just a list of dates and names—it’s about the people, the lives
          they lived, and the lessons we can learn from them. There’s so much we
          can learn from the past, both in terms of avoiding mistakes and
          understanding the change in human nature. All in all, I’m someone who
          values learning and imagination. Whether it’s through games, stories,
          myths, or history books, I love exploring different worlds—real or
          fictional—and understanding what makes them unique. These interests
          continue to shape how I see the world and how I want to engage with it
          moving forward.

        <h2 id="myAvatar">My Avatar</h2>
        <img
          src="images/Magos_Dominus_Faustinius.jpg"
          alt="The Avatar I will be using is the portrait of Magos Dominus Faustinius from the game Warhammer 40k: Mechanicus"
          title="This is Magos Dominus Faustinius from the game: Warhammer 40k: Mechanicus, the character my avatar comes from."
        />
        <p>
          I decided to use this image as my avatar for a few different reasons.
          Originally, I was just going to go with a standard profile picture of
          myself,something simple and straightforward, but after thinking about
          it a bit more, I realized that it was a bit too boring for my taste.
          Thats why I instead chose this guy for my profile picture, someone
          that can a show a bit of personality in a more creative way. If you're
          curious, hovering over the avatar reveals who the character is and
          where the image comes from, though, if you’re familiar with the
          Warhammer 40,000 universe, you might recognize it right away. The
          image is of a character that’s part of the Adeptus Mechanicus, a
          faction in the Warhammer 40K universe that is absolutely obsessed with
          machines, technology, and the worship of knowledge itself. Lately,
          I’ve been playing a game that features the Adeptus Mechanicus heavily,
          and their aesthetic and ideology fascinated me. They blend ancient
          tradition with futuristic machinery, and they see technology not just
          as a tool, but as something almost divine. I thought that was such a
          unique and intense take on how people relate to technology. But beyond
          just liking the way the image looks or the lore behind it, I also felt
          like it made a weird kind of sense for where I am in life right now.
          I’m currently studying in a Web Developer AAS degree program, where
          I’m learning all about coding, web development, and how to build
          functional, interactive digital experiences. I spend a lot of time
          thinking about how technology works and how to use it to create
          something useful or beautiful. In a very weird way, my career path of
          choice relates to the Adeptus Mechanicus: a group of people who are
          passionate about machines and strive to understand them. Using this
          avatar lets me express that part of my identity in a subtle, fun way.
          It shows that I love gaming and Table Top Games, sure,but it also
          hints at my deeper interests in technology, logic, and design. It
          connects the fictional things I enjoy to the very real goals I’m
          working toward in school and eventually in my career. And finally, the
          last reason I chose this as my profile picture is simply because I
          think it looks really cool. And sometimes, that’s more than enough
          reason on its own. In the end, my avatar is more than just a picture.
          It’s a small but meaningful way of showing who I am, what I enjoy, and
          where I’m headed.

        <h2 id="myWebDevelopmentJourney">My Web Development Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Right now, I’m enrolled in the Web Developer AAS (Associate of Applied
          Science) degree program, which is designed to teach me the skills
          needed to create functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing
          websites. This degree focuses on a wide range of web development
          topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, linux configuration, Python,
          and back-end programming. I’ve always had a strong interest in
          technology, especially the behind-the-scenes side of how websites,
          apps, and programs work. For a long time, I wanted to learn how to
          code, but I didn’t really know where to begin. The internet is full of
          resources—YouTube tutorials, online courses, forums, but the sheer
          amount of information out there can be overwhelming, especially when
          you’re just starting out. There are so many different programming
          languages to choose from, like Python, JavaScript, PHP, and more, each
          with their own specific uses, syntax, and learning curves. On top of
          that, there are frameworks, libraries, tools, and best practices to
          consider. Without structure or guidance, I found it hard to focus or
          even figure out which path would be best for me. That’s one of the
          main reasons I decided to go to college and enroll in a formal
          program. I knew that having a structured environment and a clear
          curriculum would help me learn more efficiently and stay on track. I’m
          learning step-by-step, starting with the basics and gradually building
          up to more complex concepts. It’s exactly what I needed to finally
          gain momentum and move forward with my goals. While I’m not exactly
          sure where I’ll end up after I complete my degree, I do have a general
          direction in mind. Naturally, I plan to look for a job in web
          development, since that’s what my degree is focused on. It only makes
          sense to apply what I’ve learned in a professional setting, and I’m
          eager to put my skills to work. Whether it’s building websites for
          businesses, working at a creative agency, maintaining web platforms,
          or even freelancing, I’m open to different opportunities that will
          help me grow and gain experience. What’s most important to me is that
          I’m finally on a path that feels right. I’m doing something that
          interests me, and something that has real world applications. Web
          development is a constantly evolving field, and there’s always
          something new to learn, which keeps it exciting. As I continue with my
          studies, I’m becoming more confident in my abilities and more excited
          about the future. In the end, I may not have every step of my journey
          planned out yet, but I know I’ve taken the first big step in the right
          direction,and that’s what really matters.
